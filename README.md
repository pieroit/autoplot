# autoplot

Autoplot will take a CSV as input and ask you a few questions:
You need to specify:
- details about how the CSV is formatted
- how and where to save plots
- which variables interest you
- which type they are (string, int, float)
- which variables are considered as "output"

After tha Autoplot starts, you will find all plots saved in the required folder.
There will be both distribution plots for any interest variable, and a plot for each variable vs. the output variables.
